    "## 1.1. Install Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To build this project, you need to install several Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flask**: for managing HTTP routes and handling client-server requests.\n",
    "- **Socket**: for establishing TCP/UDP connections for video and message relay.\n",
    "- **Pickle**: for serializing and deserializing Python objects, especially for sending video frames.\n",
    "- **Threading**: for handling concurrent tasks, such as listening for incoming connections while processing data.\n",
    "- **OpenCV-python**: for capturing video from the webcam and displaying it.\n",
    "- **Requests**: for making HTTP requests to communicate with the Flask server.\n",
    "- **Struct**: for packing and unpacking data to send over sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install these libraries by running the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** **socket**, **threading**, **pickle**, and **struct** are part of Python’s standard library and don’t require separate installation.\n",
